## Getting Started
Firstly, we must start the backend server to communicate with the database. We did not arrange anything remote, so you have to install everyting into the local environment.

## Steps
1) Install MySQL on your machine and create a database called `online-game-portal`. This specific name is important.
2) Clone the repository and install all dependencies by the entering command `npm install` in terminal navigating to the root directory.
3) In the `.env` file change the database password into your root password.
4) Now start the server by the command `node app/index.js`. NOTE: You must have Node.js installed
5) To start playing the games through UI, clone the git repository [Game Web Application](https://github.com/Shibadrita/game-web.git)
